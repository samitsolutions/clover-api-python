## General
This is a Python client library for Clover API v3

## Installation
Installation for the package can be done via pip.

```commandline
    pip install cloverapi-python
```

## Usage

Initialize the client with your API key:

```python
from cloverapi.cloverapi_client import CloverApiClient
api_client = CloverApiClient(api_key='XXXXXXXX', merchant_id='XXXXXXXX',
                             api_url='https://apisandbox.dev.clover.com')
```

#### Making a request

Each API call should have a related method

For instance: 

GET /v3/merchants/{mId}

maps to:

```python
api_client.merchant_service.get_merchant()
```

Each main category on the Clover documentation:

- Merchants ```api_client.merchant_service```
- Cash ```api_client.cash_service```
- Customers ```api_client.customer_service```
- Employees ```api_client.employee_service```
- Inventory ```api_client.inventory_service```
- Notifications ```api_client.notification_service```
- Orders ```api_client.order_service```
- Payments ```api_client.payment_service```
- Apps ```api_client.app_service```
